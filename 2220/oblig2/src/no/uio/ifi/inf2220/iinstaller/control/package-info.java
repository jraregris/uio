/**
 * This package holds a very simple command line interpreter,
 * and a single pass class which takes control when command line
 * arguments are given.
 * To create a fancy readline (command loop), with support for escape
 * sequences and so on is a bit messy in Java, so we'll just use a simple
 * loop which reads from standard input.
